# Setlist Scout

Ever gone to a concert, only to realize the band isn't' playing that one song you love?

Ever wanted to know what deep cuts a band is playing before you go to the show?

Setlist Scout is a web app that lets users discover the songs their favorites artists are currently playing on tour and generates Spotify playlists based on that information.

With concerts getting so ridiculously expensive, Setlist Scout helps you be more informed before a big show. And once you've bought tickets, the app can help you scout for the show so you can sing along to every song.
