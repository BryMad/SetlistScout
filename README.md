# Setlist Scout

Ever gone to a concert, only to realize the band isn't' playing that one song you love? Want to know what songs a band is playing before you see them at Coachella?

Setlist Scout lets you discover what songs your favorites artists are currently playing on tour and allows you to generate Spotify playlists of the songs your most likely to hear.

With concerts getting so ridiculously expensive, Setlist Scout helps you be more informed before a big show. Or if you've already bought tickets, the app can help you scout out the show so you can sing along to every song.
