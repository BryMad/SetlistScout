# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

SetlistScout (formerly Concert Cram) is a full-stack web application that helps users discover songs artists are playing on tour and create Spotify playlists based on recent setlists. The app integrates with Setlist.fm, Spotify, and MusicBrainz APIs.

## Common Development Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Start Redis (required for sessions)
redis-server

# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm install  # First time only
npm start    # Runs on port 5001

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd frontend
npm install  # First time only
npm run dev  # Runs on port 5173
```

### Build Commands
```bash
# Build entire project (from root)
npm run build

# Frontend only
cd frontend && npm run build

# Lint frontend code
cd frontend && npm run lint
```

### Environment Setup
- Frontend: Copy `frontend/example.env` to `frontend/.env` and set `VITE_SERVER_URL`
- Backend: Create `.env` with Spotify, Setlist.fm API credentials and Redis config

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite, Chakra UI, React Router v7, Axios
- **Backend**: Express.js, Redis (sessions), Winston (logging)
- **APIs**: Spotify OAuth 2.0, Setlist.fm, MusicBrainz, Deezer

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Session-Based Authentication**
   - Spotify tokens stored server-side in Redis sessions
   - No tokens sent to frontend (security)
   - 24-hour session expiration
   - CSRF protection via state parameter

2. **API Rate Limiting**
   - Bottleneck library for Spotify API (200ms between requests)
   - Express rate limiter (100 requests/15min per IP)
   - Graceful handling of 504 timeouts from Setlist.fm

3. **Real-Time Updates**
   - Server-Sent Events (SSE) for progress updates during setlist processing
   - SSE manager utility handles connection lifecycle

4. **Data Flow**
   - User inputs Setlist.fm URL â†’ Backend fetches artist/tour data
   - MusicBrainz validates artist mapping
   - Setlists aggregated and songs tallied by frequency
   - Optional: Create Spotify playlist with auth

### API Endpoints

- **Auth**: `/auth/login`, `/auth/callback`, `/auth/refresh`, `/auth/logout`
- **Setlist**: `/setlist/` (sync), `/setlist/search_with_updates` (streaming)
- **Playlist**: `/playlist/create_playlist` (requires auth)
- **SSE**: `/sse/connect` (real-time updates)
- **Consent**: `/consent/log`, `/consent/verify/:id`

### Frontend Structure

- `/src/pages/` - Main app pages (Home, Privacy, Terms)
- `/src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `/src/context/` - Auth and Setlist React contexts
- `/src/api/` - API service layer
- `/src/utils/` - Helper functions
- `/src/theme.js` - Chakra UI theme configuration

### Design System & Styling

1. **Theme Configuration**
   - Custom Chakra UI theme in `src/theme.js`
   - Brand colors: Indigo palette (`brand.500`, etc.)
   - Accent colors: Rose palette (`accent.500`, etc.)
   - Spotify colors: Isolated to `spotify.green` for Spotify-specific actions only
   - Modern shadow, border radius, and spacing scales

2. **Styling Approach**
   - Chakra UI component library with custom theme
   - No CSS modules or styled-components
   - Minimal global CSS (only in `src/index.css`)
   - Button hover effects and micro-interactions built into theme
   - Responsive design using Chakra's responsive props

3. **Brand Identity**
   - Independent visual identity (not affiliated with Spotify)
   - Spotify green (#1DB954) used ONLY for Spotify-specific actions
   - All other UI elements use indigo brand colors or rose accents
   - Modern glass-morphism effects and subtle animations

### Backend Structure

- `/routes/` - Express route handlers
- `/middleware/` - Auth middleware
- `/utils/` - API integrations, SSE manager, logger

## Important Development Notes

1. **No Test Suite**: Project currently lacks tests. Consider adding Jest/Vitest when implementing new features.

2. **Redis Required**: Backend won't function without Redis running for session storage.

3. **API Keys**: Requires valid Spotify Client ID/Secret and Setlist.fm API key.

4. **CORS**: Configured for localhost:5173 (dev) and production domain.

5. **Mobile Support**: Auth callback handles mobile differently (URL fragment vs postMessage).

6. **Error Handling**: Implements retry logic for external API failures.

7. **Security**: Never log or expose API tokens. All sensitive data in environment variables.

8. **Deployment**: Configured for Render.com with build commands in root package.json.

## Advanced Search Feature Implementation Status

### âœ… COMPLETED: Step 1 - Enhanced Default Flow

**Implementation Date**: July 2025

The enhanced default flow has been successfully implemented with the following features:

#### Backend Enhancements
- **Enhanced Data Fetching**: Modified search to fetch up to 60 shows (3 API calls) instead of 20
  - New functions: `getMultipleArtistPages()` and `getMultipleArtistPagesByMBID()`
  - Added logging and show count validation to prevent data overflow
- **Smart Tour Detection**: Added `analyzeTours()` function to process multiple pages and identify all tours
  - Automatically detects multiple tours with metadata (date ranges, show counts, staleness indicators)
  - Filters out VIP/soundcheck tours
  - Identifies orphan shows (individual shows not part of named tours)
- **New API Endpoints**:
  - `/analyze_tours` - Returns tour options with metadata for user selection
  - `/process_selected_tour_with_updates` - Processes selected tour with SSE progress updates
  - `/process_selected_tour` - Non-SSE version for tour processing
- **Fixed Deezer Integration**: Added missing `deezerApiCalls.js` utility with proper image format

#### Frontend Enhancements
- **Nested Dropdown UI**: Replaced full-page navigation with elegant nested dropdown
  - `TourDropdown` component appears to the right of artist selection
  - Shows "Checking tours..." during analysis
  - Clean, compact tour selection with metadata
- **Enhanced User Experience**:
  - "Recommended!" badge for most recent tours
  - "Older tour" indicators for tours >2 years old
  - Year ranges and show counts for each tour option
  - "Shows with no tour info" option for orphan shows
- **Maintained SSE Integration**: Full real-time progress updates during tour processing
  - Shows progress for setlist fetching, song analysis, and Spotify lookups
  - Proper error handling and status updates

#### Key Features Delivered
1. **Smart Tour Detection**: Analyzes 60 recent shows to identify all available tours
2. **Inline Tour Selection**: No page navigation - dropdown appears inline with artist search
3. **Tour Metadata**: Date ranges, show counts, recency indicators, and staleness warnings
4. **Orphan Show Handling**: Option for individual shows not part of named tours
5. **Real-time Progress**: SSE updates throughout the processing pipeline
6. **Improved API Efficiency**: Optimized requests with proper rate limiting and logging

#### Current User Flow
1. **Artist Search**: User types artist name â†’ Deezer suggestions appear
2. **Artist Selection**: User clicks artist â†’ Tour analysis begins ("Checking tours...")
3. **Tour Selection**: Dropdown appears with tour options and metadata
4. **Processing**: Real-time progress updates as selected tour is processed
5. **Results**: Song data appears in TracksHUD with full setlist analysis

### ðŸ”„ NEXT STEPS: Remaining Implementation

#### Step 2: Advanced Search Toggle (Future)
- Add "Advanced options" toggle to main search UI
- Create year picker component (only visible in advanced mode)
- Keep current enhanced flow as primary experience

#### Step 3: Year-based Search Implementation (Future)
- Add backend endpoint for year-filtered search
- Implement intelligent sampling for large result sets
- Group results by tour name and present selection UI

### Technical Notes
- All tour grouping uses `tour.name` property from Setlist.fm API
- Show counting is capped at 60 to prevent data overflow
- SSE integration maintained for real-time user feedback
- Mobile-responsive design implemented for all new components
- Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms in place
