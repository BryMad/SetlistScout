# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

SetlistScout (formerly Concert Cram) is a full-stack web application that helps users discover songs artists are playing on tour and create Spotify playlists based on recent setlists. The app integrates with Setlist.fm, Spotify, and MusicBrainz APIs.

## Common Development Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Start Redis (required for sessions)
redis-server

# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm install  # First time only
npm start    # Runs on port 5001

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd frontend
npm install  # First time only
npm run dev  # Runs on port 5173
```

### Build Commands
```bash
# Build entire project (from root)
npm run build

# Frontend only
cd frontend && npm run build

# Lint frontend code
cd frontend && npm run lint
```

### Environment Setup
- Frontend: Copy `frontend/example.env` to `frontend/.env` and set `VITE_SERVER_URL`
- Backend: Create `.env` with Spotify, Setlist.fm API credentials and Redis config

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite, Chakra UI, React Router v7, Axios
- **Backend**: Express.js, Redis (sessions), Winston (logging)
- **APIs**: Spotify OAuth 2.0, Setlist.fm, MusicBrainz, Deezer

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Session-Based Authentication**
   - Spotify tokens stored server-side in Redis sessions
   - No tokens sent to frontend (security)
   - 24-hour session expiration
   - CSRF protection via state parameter

2. **API Rate Limiting**
   - Bottleneck library for Spotify API (200ms between requests)
   - Express rate limiter (100 requests/15min per IP)
   - Graceful handling of 504 timeouts from Setlist.fm

3. **Real-Time Updates**
   - Server-Sent Events (SSE) for progress updates during setlist processing
   - SSE manager utility handles connection lifecycle

4. **Data Flow**
   - User selects artist ‚Üí Automatically processes most recent tour
   - MusicBrainz validates artist mapping
   - Setlists aggregated and songs tallied by frequency
   - Optional: Create Spotify playlist with auth

### API Endpoints

- **Auth**: `/auth/login`, `/auth/callback`, `/auth/refresh`, `/auth/logout`
- **Setlist**: 
  - `/setlist/` (sync - legacy endpoint)
  - `/setlist/search_with_updates` (streaming with SSE for recent tours)
  - `/setlist/search_tour_with_updates` (streaming with SSE for specific tours)
  - `/setlist/artist/:artistId/tours` (get all tours for an artist)
  - `/setlist/artist_search` (Spotify artist search)
  - `/setlist/artist_search_deezer` (Deezer artist search)
- **Playlist**: `/playlist/create_playlist` (requires auth)
- **SSE**: `/sse/connect` (real-time updates)
- **Consent**: `/consent/log`, `/consent/verify/:id`

### Frontend Structure

- `/src/pages/` - Main app pages (Home, Privacy, Terms)
- `/src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `/src/context/` - Auth and Setlist React contexts
- `/src/api/` - API service layer
- `/src/utils/` - Helper functions
- `/src/theme.js` - Chakra UI theme configuration

### Design System & Styling

1. **Theme Configuration**
   - Custom Chakra UI theme in `src/theme.js`
   - Brand colors: Indigo palette (`brand.500`, etc.)
   - Accent colors: Rose palette (`accent.500`, etc.)
   - Spotify colors: Isolated to `spotify.green` for Spotify-specific actions only
   - Modern shadow, border radius, and spacing scales

2. **Styling Approach**
   - Chakra UI component library with custom theme
   - No CSS modules or styled-components
   - Minimal global CSS (only in `src/index.css`)
   - Button hover effects and micro-interactions built into theme
   - Responsive design using Chakra's responsive props

3. **Brand Identity**
   - Independent visual identity (not affiliated with Spotify)
   - Spotify green (#1DB954) used ONLY for Spotify-specific actions
   - All other UI elements use indigo brand colors or rose accents
   - Modern glass-morphism effects and subtle animations

### Backend Structure

- `/routes/` - Express route handlers
- `/middleware/` - Auth middleware
- `/utils/` - API integrations, SSE manager, logger

## User Flow

The application provides two search modes for discovering artist setlists:

### Live Shows (Default)
1. **Artist Search**: User types artist name ‚Üí Deezer suggestions appear with artist images
2. **Artist Selection**: User clicks artist ‚Üí Immediate processing of most recent tour
3. **Progress Updates**: Real-time SSE updates during setlist processing
4. **Results**: Song data appears in TracksHUD with full setlist analysis
5. **Playlist Creation**: Optional Spotify playlist creation with authentication

### Advanced Search (Past Tours)
1. **Tab Selection**: User clicks "Past Tours" tab
2. **Artist Search**: Same Deezer-powered artist search as Live Shows
3. **Artist Selection**: User selects artist ‚Üí System fetches all historical tours
4. **Tour Selection**: Dropdown appears with all tours (e.g., "Zoo TV (161 shows)")
5. **Tour Processing**: Real-time SSE updates for specific tour setlist analysis
6. **Results**: Historical setlist data displayed in TracksHUD
7. **Playlist Creation**: Same Spotify integration for historical data

## Important Development Notes

1. **No Test Suite**: Project currently lacks tests. Consider adding Jest/Vitest when implementing new features.

2. **Redis Required**: Backend won't function without Redis running for session storage.

3. **API Keys**: Requires valid Spotify Client ID/Secret and Setlist.fm API key.

4. **CORS**: Configured for localhost:5173 (dev) and production domain.

5. **Mobile Support**: Auth callback handles mobile differently (URL fragment vs postMessage).

6. **Error Handling**: Implements retry logic for external API failures.

7. **Security**: Never log or expose API tokens. All sensitive data in environment variables.

8. **Deployment**: Configured for Render.com with build commands in root package.json.

## Advanced Search Implementation

### Current Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL WITH SEPARATED ARCHITECTURE ‚úÖ

The advanced search feature is fully implemented and working, allowing users to search historical tours for any artist. The scraping functionality has been successfully separated from the main application to comply with best practices.

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview: Scraping Service Separation

**Problem Solved**: Tour scraping that could violate setlist.fm ToS is now isolated from the main application that uses their API legitimately.

**Current Implementation**:
- `backend/utils/setlistSlugExtractor.js` - Extracts setlist.fm artist slugs using the official API ‚úÖ
- `scraper-service/` - Separate Vercel deployment for tour scraping ‚úÖ
- Main backend calls the external scraper service via HTTP ‚úÖ

### üöÄ Deployed Scraper Service

**Vercel Deployment**:
```
scraper-service/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tours/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [slug].js    # Vercel function endpoint
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ health.js        # Health check endpoint
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tourScraper.js       # Scraping logic (moved from backend)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json         # Dependencies (cheerio, axios, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vercel.json         # Deployment configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.example        # Environment variables template
```

**Service URL**: Set in backend `.env` as:
```
SCRAPER_SERVICE_URL=https://your-scraper.vercel.app
SCRAPER_API_KEY=your-generated-api-key
```

**Security**: The scraper is protected by API key authentication to prevent unauthorized access.

**How it works**:
1. Main backend gets artist slug via official setlist.fm API
2. Backend calls: `GET ${SCRAPER_SERVICE_URL}/api/tours/${artistSlug}` with `X-API-Key` header
3. Vercel function validates API key before scraping
4. Returns tour data as JSON only if authenticated
5. Backend forwards data to frontend

### üéØ Why This Architecture Is Necessary

**Technical Benefits**:
- Separates ToS-violating code from main application
- Different IP addresses reduce detection risk
- Main app can fallback gracefully if scraping service fails

**Legal Benefits**:
- Scraping and API usage come from different sources
- Reduces obvious connection between violations and API usage
- Easier to disable if needed without breaking main app

### üîß Vercel Deployment Guide

**To deploy your own scraper service:**

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy the scraper**:
   ```bash
   cd scraper-service
   vercel
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   ```bash
   vercel env add ALLOWED_ORIGINS
   # Enter: * (for testing) or your production URL
   
   vercel env add SCRAPER_API_KEY
   # Enter: Generate with 'openssl rand -hex 32'
   ```

4. **Deploy to production**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

5. **Update backend `.env`**:
   ```
   SCRAPER_SERVICE_URL=https://your-deployment.vercel.app
   SCRAPER_API_KEY=same-key-as-vercel
   ```

**Security Notes**: 
- The scraper requires API key authentication (X-API-Key header)
- Generate keys with: `openssl rand -hex 32`
- Disable Vercel's built-in authentication but keep API key protection

### üìÅ Current Advanced Search Files

**Backend Files**:
- `backend/utils/setlistSlugExtractor.js` ‚úÖ (API-only, uses official setlist.fm API)
- `backend/routes/setlistRoutes.js` ‚úÖ (calls external scraper service)
- `backend/routes/setlistRoutes.js:25` - `fetchToursFromService()` function handles scraper communication

**Scraper Service Files** (Separate Vercel deployment):
- `scraper-service/api/tours/[slug].js` ‚úÖ (Vercel function endpoint)
- `scraper-service/tourScraper.js` ‚úÖ (Scraping logic, isolated from main app)
- `scraper-service/vercel.json` ‚úÖ (Deployment configuration)

**Frontend Files**:
- `frontend/src/components/UserInput.jsx` ‚úÖ (tab interface working)
- `frontend/src/api/setlistService.js` ‚úÖ (tour-specific search working)
- `frontend/src/context/SetlistContext.jsx` ‚úÖ (context integration working)

**Dependencies**:
- Main backend: NO scraping dependencies ‚úÖ
- Scraper service: Contains `cheerio` and scraping logic ‚úÖ

### üéÆ Current Feature Status

**Working Features**:
- ‚úÖ Tab-based UI (Live Shows / Past Tours)
- ‚úÖ Artist search and selection in both tabs
- ‚úÖ Tour list fetching and display
- ‚úÖ Tour-specific setlist processing with SSE
